# ML-Spam-email-prediciton

Spam Mail Prediction

This project aims to predict whether an email is spam or not using machine learning techniques. The project involves preprocessing email data, extracting relevant features, and building a classification model to accurately distinguish spam emails from legitimate ones.

Features

Email Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing email data for analysis.

Feature Extraction: Extracting key features from emails to aid in classification.

Machine Learning Models: Training and evaluating models to achieve high accuracy in spam detection.

Technologies Used

Python: For data analysis, preprocessing, and machine learning.

Scikit-learn: For building and evaluating machine learning models.

Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.

Matplotlib/Seaborn: For data visualization.
